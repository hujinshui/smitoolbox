Specifications of models
============================

This document specifies the data structures that represent several common
mixture models


1. Solution to Finite Mixture Model Estimation

(1.a) For E-M algorithm, the solution s is a struct with the following 
fields:

s.K:            The number of mixture components
s.Pi:           The prior distribution of components [K x 1 vector]
s.params:       The parameters of mixture components
s.Q:            The posterior probability matrix [K x n matrix]
                (where n is the number of training samples)

(1.b) For Gibbs sampling algorithm, the solution is slightly different

s.K:            The number of mixture components
s.Pi:           The prior distribution of components [K x 1 vector]
s.params:       The parameters of mixture components
s.z:            The per-sample labels [1 x n vector]
