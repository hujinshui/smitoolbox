How to install smitoolbox
==========================

Last Modified on Apirl 14, 2011, by Dahua Lin.


Platforms
---------

- smitoolbox was developed in MATLAB 2010a, and should work well in all 
  MATLAB versions above it.

- The toolbox uses a series of C++ mex files, which were succesfully
  built and tested using Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0/10.0 and GNU C++ 4.2.x.

- The toolbox was tested and should work in three major operating systems:
  Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.
 


Dependencies
------------

Statistical Modeling and Inference Toolbox (smitoolbox) depends on two
C++ libraries.

- Basic Computation Supporting Library (bcslib): 

http://code.google.com/p/bcslib/

- Boost C++ Library:

http://www.boost.org/



Step by Step
------------

0. Install Mercurial (Hg). 

    Mercurial is a distributed version control system used by Google 
    Project Host. It is free, and availabel in almostly all major 
    platforms (including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X).

    You need this software to checkout and update smitoolbox and
    bcslib.

    Linux and Mac OS X users can download it from the official website:
    http://mercurial.selenic.com/

    Windows users are strongly recommended to use TortoiseHg, which has 
    a much friendly GUI interface integrated with windows explorer. 
    It is also free, and is available in http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/

    For those who have never used Mercurial before, you can consider it
    as an improved and distributed version of SVN. There is a very nice
    user guide in its official website.


1. Install boost.

    If you already have boost installed, you can skip this step.

    Download the C++ Boost library and uncompress the package. We note 
    that smitoolbox only uses some graph algorithms in Boost Graph Lib,
    which are all in header files. Hence, you don't need to build the
    Boost library if you just use it to support smitoolbox.

2. Install bcslib.

    If you already have bcslib installed, you can skip this step.

    Checkout the library. That's it (you don't need to do 'make', as
    smitoolbox relies only on headers of this library).

3. Set environment variable.

    Set BOOST_HOME to the home directory of boost library. 

    (The home directory of boost is the one that contains the 
    file "INSTALL", and sub-directories "boost", "doc", "libs", etc.)

    Set BCSLIB_HOME to the home directory of bcslib.

    (The home directory of bcslib is the one that contains the
     file "Makefile", and sub-directories "bcslib", "test", and "msvc", etc.)


4. In-MATLAB setup.

    Now, you can start MATLAB, and finish the setup as follows. 
    
    (a) Switch into the directory of smitoolbox. 

    (b) You may find a sub-directory named "tbman", which contains the
        functions to setup and manage the toolbox.

    (c) Go into the tbman directory.

    (d) Run smi_add_path. It will add all necessary paths to MATLAB's path 
        list. Note that this function only adds path to current session.
        If you want to keep the paths after you exit matlab, you may 
        type in "savepath" to save them.

    (e) Run smi_build_mex. This will build all mex files in the toolbox.
        
    If both smi_add_path and smi_build_mex runs ok, the toolbox is ready 
    for use. Congratulations!

Thanks for all your patience to read through the instructions. If you have
any questions in regard to the toolbox, please feel free to write to
